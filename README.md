My name is Stephen Escarzaga. I got my Bachelor of Science in Environmental Science at UTEP and began my Masters in Environmental Science  in 2015. I'll be switching over to a PhD in Environmental Science & Engineering at UTEP this summer. My research interests are improving characterizations of Arctic coastal dynamics utilizing several remote sensing methods.
